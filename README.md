# cowaxess-legacy

This repository preserves the last available version of Cowaxcess (aka the last version i had on my backup drive.)
Since CowAxess does not want to preserve legacy downloads for "For security and reliability reasons"

This project is no longer actively distributed or maintained upstream and is preserved here as a legacy archive.
